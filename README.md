# 📉 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
**A Data-Driven Strategic Solution for Customer Retention**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project addresses the critical business challenge of **customer churn** in the telecommunications sector. Using predictive analytics and strategic business frameworks, our goal was to identify high-risk customers and support proactive retention efforts.

Our solution integrates a **Random Forest model** with a **Streamlit web application**, allowing business users to perform **real-time predictions** with ease — bridging the gap between analytics and direct business action.

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes

- 🔍 **Identified churn drivers** such as:
  - Payment delays
  - High volume of support calls
  - Short contract durations
  - Low usage frequency

- 🧠 **Developed a machine learning model** using Random Forest (**95% accuracy**)

- 🖥️ **Built a Streamlit web app** for:
  - Real-time churn predictions via manual input
  - Making model insights accessible to business stakeholders

- 🧩 **Applied strategy models** like **SWOT**, **TOWS**, and **Value Chain Analysis** to align analytics with practical recommendations

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for EDA and modeling
- **Streamlit** for app development and deployment
- **Dataset**: [Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshahidazeem/customer-churn-dataset/data)

## 📈 Strategic Recommendation

We recommend a **combined approach** focused on:

- 🎯 **Targeted retention programs** using model predictions
- 📞 **Proactive customer support** based on key churn indicators
- 🔁 **Contract restructuring** to shift users to long-term value plans

This strategy balances **data accuracy**, **customer centricity**, and **scalability**, inspired by real-world practices such as those in **Jabil** and **Tesla** case studies.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

We plan to enhance the project further with the following features:

- 📁 **Batch Prediction via CSV Upload**:  
  Allow users to upload a CSV file containing multiple customer records and receive churn predictions for all entries in one go. This will improve usability for business analysts handling large volumes of customer data.

- 📊 **Dashboard Integration**:  
  Visualize churn prediction trends, customer segmentation, and historical model performance using interactive charts within the Streamlit app.

- 🔄 **Model Retraining Interface**:  
  Enable periodic retraining using new customer data to maintain model accuracy over time.

- 🔐 **Authentication Layer**:  
  Add secure login to restrict access to authorized users, especially if deployed in a business setting.
